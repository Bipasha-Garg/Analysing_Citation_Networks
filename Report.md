`    Decrease in Clustering Coefficient:`

        The clustering coefficient measures the tendency of nodes to form clusters or groups in a network. A decrease in the clustering coefficient indicates a reduction in the local density of connections between neighboring nodes.

        This could imply that the citation network is becoming more decentralized or that the connections between papers are less likely to form closed triads (clusters of interconnected nodes). Papers might be citing a more diverse set of sources or there could be an increasing influence of external factors impacting the network structure.


`    Increase in the Number of Communities:`

        The number of communities in a network refers to the presence of distinct groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network. An increase in the number of communities suggests a higher level of modularity or compartmentalization within the citation network.

        This might indicate the emergence of more specialized or niche areas of research within high-energy physics. Papers within each community may share more common references and themes, contributing to the formation of distinct clusters.

    We can observe a sudden drop in the papers in 2002 which could be potentially because the dataset is biased since before the sudden drop the papers published were around average only.

## ALGORITHM TO FIND COMMUNITES

`Louvain Method:`

    Modularity-Based Approach: The Louvain method is a modularity-based algorithm. It aims to maximize the modularity of the network, which is a measure that evaluates the quality of a division of a network into communities.

    Greedy Optimization: The Louvain method employs a greedy optimization technique, where nodes are iteratively moved between communities to improve the modularity.

    Fast and Scalable: It is known for its speed and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale networks.

`Girvan-Newman Algorithm:`

    Edge Betweenness-Based Approach: The Girvan-Newman algorithm focuses on edge betweenness, which measures the number of shortest paths that pass through a particular edge. Edges with high betweenness are considered as bridges between communities.

    Hierarchical Clustering: It uses a hierarchical clustering approach, systematically removing edges with the highest betweenness until communities are revealed.

    Computationally Intensive: The Girvan-Newman algorithm can be computationally intensive, especially on large networks, due to the need to calculate betweenness for all edges.

`Comparison:`
Objective Function: Louvain optimizes modularity, while Girvan-Newman aims to identify edges with high betweenness. The objectives are different, and the algorithms have different ways of achieving their goals.

    Speed and Scalability: Louvain is often considered faster and more scalable, making it suitable for large networks. Girvan-Newman can be computationally expensive, particularly on larger graphs.

    Community Structure: The choice between the algorithms may depend on the nature of the community structure in the network. Some networks may have a modular structure that aligns well with modularity optimization (Louvain), while others may have communities separated by bridges (Girvan-Newman).

`Which is Better:`
The choice between Louvain and Girvan-Newman depends on the specific characteristics of the network and the goals of the analysis. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the suitability of each algorithm can vary based on factors such as network size, density, and the nature of community structures.

In general, Louvain is often preferred for its speed and efficiency, especially in large networks, but Girvan-Newman may be more suitable when analyzing networks with distinct bridge-like edges between communities.

    As we can observe in the below images that Louvain Algorithm gives us more dense communities whereas in girvan it is not the case.

    Observation: An additional observation based on the provided images is that larger communities appear to experience more significant growth compared to smaller ones over the years 1998-2001. The images suggest that the size disparity between large and small communities becomes more pronounced as time progresses.

    This observation may indicate a potential cumulative advantage or preferential attachment phenomenon, where well-established and larger communities attract more attention, collaboration, and citations. As these larger communities accumulate more contributors and citations, they might have a competitive edge over smaller communities, leading to their continued growth.

    The disparity in growth rates between large and small communities could be influenced by factors such as the visibility of prominent researchers, the appeal of well-established research topics, and the network effects that come with being part of a larger and more interconnected community.

    This dynamic pattern underscores the importance of understanding the mechanisms driving the growth of research communities and raises questions about how to ensure equitable opportunities for smaller communities to thrive and contribute meaningfully to the academic landscape.

    In summary, the observation suggests that, over the years 1998-2001, larger communities tend to experience more substantial growth compared to smaller ones, possibly reflecting a pattern of cumulative advantage in the academic and research domains.
