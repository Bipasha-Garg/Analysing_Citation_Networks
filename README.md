# Analysing_Citation_Networks
This involves exploring the High-energy physics citation network. Arxiv HEP-PH (high energy physics phenomenology) citation graph is from the e-print arXiv. If a paper i cites paper j, the graph contains directed edge from i to j. If a paper cites, or is cited by, a paper outside the dataset, the graph does not contain any information about this.
